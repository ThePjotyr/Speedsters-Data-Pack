# ThePjotyr's Flash Data pack

This Data pack adds to your Minecraft game speedster super powers, which are heavily inspired by CW TV show **"The Flash"**.
Obtain super speed, run faster than ever, defy rules of physics and become the impossible.

## Installation
This data pack doesn't require any additonal resource pack or any mod, so it's fairly simple to install into any Minecraft world.

 - You can add the data pack to your world during it's creation in "More" tab. In "Data Packs" option click on the "Open Pack Folder" and drop .zip file containing data pack files into opened folder. Then make sure that this datapack is selected and proceed with world creation.

- Adding data pack to pre-existing world is also relatively easy. Just drop the .zip file containing data pack files into "datapacks" folder inside saved game folder. Below is displayed default directory for this folder:
> %AppData%/Roaming/.minecraft/saves/\<world>/datapacks

- It is also possible to add this data pack to any server, since it's multiplayer compatible. It's depended on where server files are located, but installing should be pretty much the same like for pre-existing world.
>  /<server's directory>/world/datapacks

## Getting powers

In order to became a speedster, player needs to find a source for their power.
Listed below are available sources.

### Thunder Strike

If player is affected by speed, regeneration and poison effects simultaneously and then is struck by lightning bolt, there's a small chance that the player will be granted connection to the Speed Force.

### Particle Accelerator

Player can build a **Particle Accelerator**, which is a single-block contraption. During storm, if it's powered with redstone and has **Positive** or **Negative Particle** inside of it, **Particle Accelerator** after couple of seconds will explode. One random player within the explosion radius will have a great chance of being granted connection to the **Speed Force**, if the particle was **Positive**, or **Negative Speed Force**, if the particle was **Negative**. 
There is also a really small possibility, that no player would get speedster powers from explosion.

### Velocity 9 Potion

Player can also craft the **Velocity 9** potion, which will surely grant anyone who drinks it temporary speedster powers. 
There are certain drawback that come with it, but more about it later.

## Using powers

Every speedster will have name of their speed source displayed above their hotbar, so players will know whether they are speedsters or not.
To access speed related abilities, player must first select last slot on hotbar. Then the display above the hotbar would change to **Speed Level Indicator**.
By running with selected last slot, player will gain speed. Continous running increases player's speed, and not running decreases it.

With selected last slot, player can also press shift to begin **phasing**. In this state, player is invulnerable, but also cannot harm anything or anyone. Other than that, if player looks straight down, the player will **phase** through the floor. The same can be achieved horizontally by looking straight forward and being close to any wall.

While running, if the player reaches 10th **Speed Level**, the indicator above hotbar will slowly turn white. When whole indicator is white, the player will create a wormhole and will be teleported into the **Speed Force** or **Negative Speed Force**, depending on player's speed source. In there, the player can travel great distances, because like in the nether, 1 block in Speed Force is equal to 8 blocks in overworld. To escape from **Speed Force**, player must do the same thing, that got the player there - reach 10th **Speed Level**. Leaving **Speed Force** has a small chance of leaving player in the nether or in the end.

It should also be noted, that by doing absolutely nothing and having selected last slot in hotbar, the player will have visual electric sparks around him, which only purpouse is to make the player look cool.

## Speedster Suits

Any speedster without special suit will not reach any **Speed Level** above 7th. To get one of the suits, player must craft them in the crafting table . Player can also craft the **Suit Ring**, in order to store suits and quickly equip them.
By wearing the speedster suit, if the player presses shift while holding empty ring, the suit will be stored inside the ring.
By holding the **Suit Ring** with a suit inside, if the player presses shift, the suit will spawn into the world. Running into the suit will equip it.

## Speed Sources

For now, there are only three sources - **Speed Force**, **Negative Speed Force** and **Velocity 9**. Every speedster can use the same abilities, but there are slight or not so slight differences between sources.

### Speed Force

The safest option. Users lightning color will be yellow. In future versions, **Speed Force** users will be debuffed around **Negative Speed Force** users.

### Negative Speed Force

Users of this source will have a red lightning. While travelling dimensions, users of this source will have their own seperate dimension called **Negative Speed Force**. In future versions, those users will debuff any **Speed Force** user in close proximity, but they will have a drawback to that.

### Velocity 9

The riskiest option. Users of this source will have a blue lightning. They will reach any **Speed Level** faster than other speedsters, but after some time, they will get a small debuffs, like nausea or taking random damage. Those effects will strengthen in time, and after preciselly 5 minutes from taking speed drug, users will die from those effects. They can prolong the inevitable, by drinking another **Velocity 9** potion, but each time they would do that, the rate their body decays will get faster and faster. The only permanent cure for this condition is obtaining speed from different source in **Particle Accelerator** explosion.
After dying from **Velocity 9** posioning, player cannot obtain speed power from any other source than **Velocity 9**.
In future versions this system will be reworked.
